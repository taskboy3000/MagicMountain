# Magic Mountain — AGENTS.md

> Reimplementation of Magic Mountain on a clean foundation.

---

## What Is This?

**Magic Mountain** is a multiplayer, seasonal push-your-luck web game. Players
extract strange artifacts from a mysterious mountain, destabilize ("push") them
for greater value (risking catastrophic collapse), and sell to competing
factions. Each ~30 day season is a tournament: highest cumulative score wins.

**Core loop**: Prospect → Push (repeat) → Stop → Sell at Bazaar → Repeat until
out of AP → Day rollover → Season ends.

This is a ground-up reimplementation following the architecture spec in
`GAME_ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Current Status: Complete Core Implementation

The entire core game loop is implemented and tested:

| Layer | Status | Files |
|-------|--------|-------|
| App shell | Done | `MagicMountain.pm`, `Controller.pm`, `Controller/Root.pm` |
| Persistence | Done | `Model.pm` + all Model::* subclasses |
| Auth/Sessions | Done | `Controller/Sessions.pm`, `Controller/Player.pm`, `Model/Session.pm` |
| CLI commands | Done | 8 commands (account management, season lifecycle, simulation) |
| Web UI | Done | Login, game state, prospecting, market, shed, skills, leaderboard |
| Prospecting | Done | `Activity/Prospecting.pm`, `Controller/Prospecting.pm` |
| MarketVisit | Done | `Activity/MarketVisit.pm`, `Controller/Market.pm` |
| Shed / Decay | Done | `ShedManager.pm`, `Model/ShedItem.pm`, `Controller/Shed.pm` |
| Daily Maintenance | Done | `Maintenance.pm` (in-process timer, AP refresh, decay, Crier) |
| Faction System | Done | YAML-driven factions, standing, influence, Crier |
| Skills | Done | `Controller/Skills.pm`, `content/skills.yml` |
| Season Lifecycle | Done | CLI create/end, auto-creation, recap, Hall of Fame |
| Bot Simulation | Done | `Command/simulate.pm`, `t/bot_simulate.t` |

### Known Gaps

See `FUTURES.md` for detailed categorization. Summary:

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| Game activities (Prospecting, Market) | **Done** |
| Daily maintenance | **Done** |
| Factions + Crier | **Done** |
| Season finalization | **Done** (CLI only, no web UI) |
| Bot simulation | **Done** (single hardcoded strategy) |
| Commission system (§7.3) | Not implemented |
| Market dynamics (§6.7) | Not implemented |
| MariaDB migration | Deferred — JSON persistence writes entire table on every `save()`. This caps simulations at ~500 total bot-days for reasonable runtime. See FUTURES.md for details. |
| CSRF / rate limiting / password auth | Deferred for alpha |

## Running the App

```bash
# Start dev server
perl -Ilib script/mountain daemon

# CLI commands
perl -Ilib script/mountain create-account --name alice
perl -Ilib script/mountain list-accounts
perl -Ilib script/mountain simulate --players 10 --days 5
perl -Ilib script/mountain end-season
```

### RAM Disk for Simulation Speed

The JSON persistence layer writes the entire table on every `save()`, so
simulation I/O is a bottleneck — especially on a VM. Use a tmpfs RAM disk:

```bash
# One-time setup (after reboot):
sudo bin/setup_ramdisk

# Run simulations with TMPDIR pointing at the ramdisk:
TMPDIR=/mnt/ramdisk perl -Ilib script/mountain simulate --count 10 --days 14
```

This redirects File::Temp's tempdir (where sim data lives) to RAM instead of
disk, which significantly speeds up simulation runs.

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
prove -l t/

# Run specific test
prove -lv t/prospecting_web.t
```

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Web framework | Mojolicious 9.40+ (Perl) |
| Persistence | JSON files with atomic write-via-temp-file + flock |
| Config | YAML (`magic_mountain.yml`, `content/*.yml`) |
| Frontend | Bootstrap 5.3 CDN, vanilla JS |
| Testing | Test::More, Test::Mojo |
| Perl | 5.28+ with signatures (`-signatures`) |

---

## Key Conventions

- **Models**: Subclass `MagicMountain::Model`. Declare `columns`, use
  `getCol`/`setCol` accessors. Persist with `save()`, load with `load()`,
  query with `find()`.
- **Activities**: Subclass `MagicMountain::Activity`. Declare `transitions`,
  implement one handler per action. Dispatch via `$activity->dispatch($char, $action)`.
  Handlers own all persistence (saves, deletes, FK management).
- **Controllers**: Return JSON. Use `$self->session(playerId => ...)` for auth.
  Dumb pipes — call `dispatch`, pipe `view` to template.
- **Commands**: Subclass `Mojolicious::Command`. Register namespace in
  `MagicMountain.pm`.
- **Config**: Add defaults in `MagicMountain.pm` → `defaultConfig`. Override
  in `magic_mountain.yml`. `end_of_day_hour` is 0–23 (midnight default).
- **Tests**: Use `Test::Mojo` for integration. Use `tempdir(CLEANUP => 1)`
  with `$ENV{MM_DATA_DIR}` for isolated state.
- **Test data seeding**: Never write JSON files directly (`write_file` to
  `*.json`). Always use Model objects (`->create`, `->save`) to set up
  test state. This ensures tests work across persistence backends and
  exercises the Model API.
- **Formatting**: Run `make indent && make clean` before every commit to ensure
  consistent perltidy formatting.
- **Fix bad patterns on sight**: LLMs reproduce the patterns they see in the
  current codebase. When you encounter a suboptimal pattern (e.g., raw JSON
  writes, copy-pasted boilerplate, inconsistent naming, missing tests), fix it
  immediately rather than replicating it or leaving a TODO. Every bad pattern
  left in place compounds — it becomes the template for the next change.
- **No automatic commits**: Never commit without being asked. Only commit when
  the user explicitly instructs it. This prevents surprise history changes.
- **Balance checks**: Run `make check-coverage` for fast static validation
  that all faction interest tags have adequate artifact coverage. Run
  `make check-loyalist` (~15s) to verify each faction can support a viable
  loyalist strategy via simulation. Run these when modifying
  `content/prospecting.yml` or `content/factions.yml`.

## Design Vault

The `design_docs/` directory is the canonical design reference. When in doubt
about *how the game should work*, consult:
1. `design_docs/Core Design.md` — game vision and philosophy
2. `design_docs/Artifact Mechanics.md` — core math
3. `design_docs/Engine Design.md` — systems and architecture
4. `design_docs/Tone Guide.md` — writing style
5. `GAME_ARCHITECTURE.md` — target rebuild specification

## Source of Truth

| Concern | Authority |
|---------|-----------|
| What the game should do | `design_docs/` + `GAME_ARCHITECTURE.md` |
| New codebase structure | This directory (`lib/`, `t/`, `templates/`) |
